621	exposure to pesticides in relation to several health outcomes, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, infertility, and asthma	Pesticides are a family of compounds which have brought many benefits to mankind in the agricultural, industrial, and health areas, but their toxicities in both humans and animals have always been a concern.	2.0
622	exposure to pesticides in relation to several health outcomes, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, infertility, and asthma	Regardless of acute poisonings which are common for some classes of pesticides like organophosphoruses, the association of chronic and sub-lethal exposure to pesticides with a prevalence of some persistent diseases is going to be a phenomenon to which global attention has been attracted.	2.0
623	exposure to pesticides in relation to several health outcomes, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, infertility, and asthma	In this review, incidence of various malignant, neurodegenerative, respiratory, reproductive, developmental, and metabolic diseases in relation to different routes of human exposure to pesticides such as occupational, environmental, residential, parental, maternal, and paternal has been systematically criticized in different categories of pesticide toxicities like carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, pulmonotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, and metabolic toxicity.	3.5
624	exposure to pesticides in relation to several health outcomes, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, infertility, and asthma	A huge body of evidence exists on the possible role of pesticide exposures in the elevated incidence of human diseases such as cancers, Alzheimer, Parkinson, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, asthma, bronchitis, infertility, birth defects, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, diabetes, and obesity.	5.0
625	exposure to pesticides in relation to several health outcomes, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, infertility, and asthma	Most of the disorders are induced by insecticides and herbicides most notably organophosphorus, organochlorines, phenoxyacetic acids, and triazine compounds.	2.5
626	once-weekly, hypofractionated therapy led to similarly low normal tissue effects as conventional therapy at two years following treatment	Randomised trials testing 15- or 16-fraction regimens of adjuvant radiotherapy in women with early breast cancer have reported favourable outcomes compared with standard fractionation.	3.0
627	once-weekly, hypofractionated therapy led to similarly low normal tissue effects as conventional therapy at two years following treatment	To evaluate hypofractionation further, two 5-fraction schedules delivering 1 fraction per week have been tested against a 25-fraction regimen.	3.0
628	once-weekly, hypofractionated therapy led to similarly low normal tissue effects as conventional therapy at two years following treatment	Women aged ⩾50years with node negative early breast cancer were randomly assigned after microscopic complete tumour resection to 50Gy in 25 fractions versus 28.5 or 30Gy in 5 once-weekly fractions of 5.7 or 6.0Gy, respectively, to the whole breast.	3.0
629	once-weekly, hypofractionated therapy led to similarly low normal tissue effects as conventional therapy at two years following treatment	The primary endpoint was 2-year change in photographic breast appearance.	2.0
630	once-weekly, hypofractionated therapy led to similarly low normal tissue effects as conventional therapy at two years following treatment	Nine hundred and fifteen women were recruited from 2004 to 2007.	1.0
631	once-weekly, hypofractionated therapy led to similarly low normal tissue effects as conventional therapy at two years following treatment	Seven hundred and twenty-nine patients had 2-year photographic assessments.	1.0
632	once-weekly, hypofractionated therapy led to similarly low normal tissue effects as conventional therapy at two years following treatment	Risk ratios for mild/marked change were 1.70 (95% CI 1.26-2.29, p<0.001) for 30Gy and 1.15 (0.82-1.60, p=0.489) for 28.5Gy versus 50Gy.	1.0
633	once-weekly, hypofractionated therapy led to similarly low normal tissue effects as conventional therapy at two years following treatment	Three-year rates of physician-assessed moderate/marked adverse effects in the breast were 17.3% (13.3-22.3%, p<0.001) for 30Gy and 11.1% (7.9-15.6%, p=0.18) for 28.5Gy compared with 9.5% (6.5-13.7%) after 50Gy.	2.0
634	once-weekly, hypofractionated therapy led to similarly low normal tissue effects as conventional therapy at two years following treatment	With a median follow-up in survivors of 37.3months, 2 local tumour relapses and 23 deaths have occurred.	1.0
635	once-weekly, hypofractionated therapy led to similarly low normal tissue effects as conventional therapy at two years following treatment	At 3years median follow-up, 28.5Gy in 5 fractions is comparable to 50Gy in 25 fractions, and significantly milder than 30Gy in 5 fractions, in terms of adverse effects in the breast.	2.0
636	nearly 73 percent of U.S. fertility clinics offer gender selection	This study aimed to determine the current percentage of United States (U.S.) assisted reproductive technology (ART) clinics offering sex selection via pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS) for non-medical purposes.	3.0
637	nearly 73 percent of U.S. fertility clinics offer gender selection	The authors conducted website review and telephone interview survey of 493 US ART clinics performing in vitro fertilization (IVF) in 2017.	2.0
638	nearly 73 percent of U.S. fertility clinics offer gender selection	Main outcome measures were pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS)/pre-implantation genetic diagnosis  practices and non-medical sex selection practices including family balancing.	2.0
