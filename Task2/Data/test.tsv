422	warmer temperatures might decrease the activity of brown fat tissue , which burns fat and generates heat in colder weather	The function of brown adipose tissue is to transfer energy from food into heat; physiologically, both the heat produced and the resulting decrease in metabolic efficiency can be of significance.	2.0
423	warmer temperatures might decrease the activity of brown fat tissue , which burns fat and generates heat in colder weather	Both the acute activity of the tissue, i.e., the heat production, and the recruitment process in the tissue (that results in a higher thermogenic capacity) are under the control of norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves.	2.0
424	warmer temperatures might decrease the activity of brown fat tissue , which burns fat and generates heat in colder weather	In thermoregulatory thermogenesis, brown adipose tissue is essential for classical nonshivering thermogenesis (this phenomenon does not exist in the absence of functional brown adipose tissue), as well as for the cold acclimation-recruited norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis.	2.0
425	warmer temperatures might decrease the activity of brown fat tissue , which burns fat and generates heat in colder weather	Heat production from brown adipose tissue is activated whenever the organism is in need of extra heat, e.g., postnatally, during entry into a febrile state, and during arousal from hibernation, and the rate of thermogenesis is centrally controlled via a pathway initiated in the hypothalamus.	3.0
426	warmer temperatures might decrease the activity of brown fat tissue , which burns fat and generates heat in colder weather	Feeding as such also results in activation of brown adipose tissue; a series of diets, apparently all characterized by being low in protein, result in a leptin-dependent recruitment of the tissue; this metaboloregulatory thermogenesis is also under hypothalamic control.	2.0
